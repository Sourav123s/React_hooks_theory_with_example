## **`useTransition` in React**

## **What is `useTransition`?**

`useTransition` is a React Hook that allows you to manage state transitions that are non-urgent. It enables you to mark certain updates as low-priority, providing a smoother user experience by deferring these updates.

### **Syntax:**

```javascript
const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
```

- `isPending`: A boolean indicating whether the transition is ongoing.
- `startTransition`: A function to wrap around state updates that you want to mark as non-urgent.

## **When to Use `useTransition`**

1. **For Non-Urgent State Updates:**

   - Use it for updates that do not need to happen immediately, such as updating a list based on a search query.

2. **Avoiding UI Blocking:**

   - Prevent the UI from freezing during expensive updates.

3. **Enhancing User Experience:**
   - Keep the UI responsive by prioritizing urgent updates while deferring non-urgent ones.

## **Example Usage**

### **1. Search Input with Deferred Updates**

```javascript
import React, { useState, useTransition } from "react";

function SearchComponent({ items }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const [filteredItems, setFilteredItems] = useState(items);
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const value = e.target.value;
    setQuery(value);

    startTransition(() => {
      setFilteredItems(
        items.filter((item) => item.toLowerCase().includes(value.toLowerCase()))
      );
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={query}
        onChange={handleChange}
        placeholder="Search..."
      />
      {isPending && <p>Updating list...</p>}
      <ul>
        {filteredItems.map((item, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default SearchComponent;
```

## **Best Practices for `useTransition`**

1. **Use for Non-Critical Updates:**

   - Only wrap updates that are not immediately critical to the user experience.

2. **Fallback UI:**

   - Provide feedback (e.g., a loading spinner or message) to indicate that a transition is in progress.

3. **Combine with Concurrent Features:**
   - Pair `useTransition` with other concurrent features in React for the best results.

## **Common Pitfalls**

1. **Overusing Transitions:**

   - Avoid marking too many updates as low-priority, as it can lead to a delayed user experience.

2. **Complex State Management:**
   - Be cautious when combining `useTransition` with complex state updates to avoid unintended side effects.

## **Conclusion**

`useTransition` is a powerful tool for improving the responsiveness of React applications by deferring non-urgent updates. Use it judiciously to strike a balance between performance and
